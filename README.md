# Shipping Mesos Cluster with Swarmkit

Swarm, are u kiding? yes, i will introduce new way to deploy and use mesos
cluster. here i want to explain why swarm is a better deliver system to deploy
any way environment. and Docker also is good fit on cross environment. we don't
care the swarm to instead of mesos. we know mesos's more stable feature than
swarm. trust me, mesos is production ready cluster system, it also support big
data infrastructure tooling than docker. in last session, i will demo how to
one click to deploy a 3-master mesos cluster and auto configuration based on
the ip.
